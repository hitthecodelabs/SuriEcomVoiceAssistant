# SuriEcomVoiceAssistant

Welcome to our voice-enabled e-commerce platform, an innovative solution that combines the traditional functionalities of online shopping with the convenience of voice and text commands. Built on Django, this e-commerce system offers a seamless and interactive shopping experience, allowing users to navigate, select, and purchase products using voice commands.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Sign up and create your account to start shopping.
- **Login/Logout**: Securely sign in and out of your account.
- **Product Browsing**: Explore a variety of products with the option to view different models if available.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add multiple items or quantities to your cart, view, and manage them with ease.
- **Checkout**: Review your potential invoice, see the total amount, and proceed to the secure payment page.
- **Voice and Text Commands**: Interact with the e-commerce platform using intuitive voice and text commands in both Spanish and English.

## Voice Command Highlights

Activate the microphone on the right-hand side with a button that captures real-time speech in the Chrome browser and translates it into actionable commands. Here are some examples:

- "suri necesito información" (suri I need information)
- "suri go home"
- "suri me quiero registrar" (suri I want to register)
- "suri quiero iniciar sesión" (suri I want to log in)
- "suri quiero cerrar sesión" (suri I want to log out)
- "suri me interesa/quiero ver/muéstrame" (suri I'm interested/I want to see/show me)
- "agrega + <producto, ej backpack>" (add + <product, e.g., backpack>)
- "suri quiero ver el carrito" (suri I want to view the cart)
- "suri quiero pagar" (suri I want to pay)
